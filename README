NAME

DocPatch - patching documents that matter

SYNOPSIS
========

docpatch [output] [command] [options]

DESCRIPTION
===========

Who we are
----------

We are part of the Open Data movement and supports the Open Definition
(http://opendefinition.org/okd/). Our way is to "hack" on documents and
build Free Software around them---our goal is to bring open data to
governments---our idea is to re-publish constitutions, law texts, and
any other public documents in a way everyone and everything may use
them.

What DocPatch stands for
------------------------

DocPatch is our platform to provide these documents to you. It relies on
some simple tools from software development. The "heart" of this
platform is a version control system (vcs) to manage the documents with
their complete history and additional meta information. The documents
itself are written in a markup language which allows us a) to use any
text editor and b) to convert the texts into any format we want.

This is our current tool stack:

-   vcs: git (http://git-scm.com/)
-   converter: pandoc (http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/index.html)
-   markup language: pandoc's enhanced markdown
    (http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)

These tools are simple to use, but powerful, widely spread, and open.
(Even if they won't fit any more in the future, they could be replaced
by other, even better tools. For distributing the repositories, the
code, the generated documents, and everything else we use some more
tools, e. g. web server, operating system,..., but they don't matter for
our intended purpose.)

First Milestone
---------------

Our first target is the German constitution, called "Grundgesetz". First
published in March 23th 1949 it was changed round about 60 times. It's
interesting to see why it was changed, when, by whom and under what
circumstances. The good is: All information is public. The bad: The
information doesn't match the Open Definition and many details are hard
to find.

In short: We are putting the complete "Grundgesetz" under version
control und publish it. Read more about on our website:
